Stranded at the drive-in, so to speak, Uttley has misplaced his driver's license. Having neither valid ID nor a vehicle, he cannot travel by plane, train or bus... can't get from Oregon back to Indiana...

Being high-sided on the West Coast is not the greatest of Uttley's concerns. There seems to be something the matter with his mind.

Poor psychotic Uttley - what is to become of him?
