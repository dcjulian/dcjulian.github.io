     When we first catch sight of Eugene Uttley, he is walking down a city street in the rain, jerking his head from side to side and talking out loud to the voices he hears in his mind. We soon discover both the cause of this odd behavior and a remedy for it that he is working on. Stranded at the drive-in, so to speak, Uttley has misplaced his driver's license. Having neither valid ID nor a vehicle, he cannot travel by plane, train or bus... can't get from Oregon back to Indiana...To reach the roots of Uttley's disorder, we dig back to his time in Alaska, and in South Korea, where he taught English as a Second Language for five years. In Korea, we follow his teaching career as he moves to the gorgeous, sub-tropical island of Jeju. A prosperous period of romance, fulfilling work, and wholesome recreation in Korea gives way to binge drinking and delusion as Uttley enters unknowingly into the 'prodromal period' of schizophrenia. Reeling now in full-blown psychosis, Uttley flies back and forth from Seoul, where he encounters some intriguing internationals. He has lost his passport, and makes repeated attempts to get a new one, but is turned away from the consulate for lack of funds, and winds up living in the streets, an illegal alien. There, he meets monks and artists and homeless people, and continues in rampant delusion and hallucination for weeks until at last he receives financial help from his family and manages to return to the USA. Uttley's disorder persists unchecked for months stateside as he drives his father's truck to the East Coast and around the Midwest, trying to solve the mystery of the voices he hears in his mind. He fantasizes contact with spies, celebrities, aliens, and deities, among other delusions and hallucinations. He visits his parents, and they offer support, but he hides the severity of his disorder from them and leaves on a Greyhound bus for the West Coast, bringing this synopsis full circle to where we first meet him.
