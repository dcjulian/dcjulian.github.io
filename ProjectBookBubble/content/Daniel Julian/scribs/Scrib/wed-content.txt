	<blockquote><h2><p><font color="brown">Eesh - here it is 1:30 eastern, and I've barely begun today's >=1 site/day for >= 1 week website.<p>
	<br>
	<p>I promise you, I am right now staring at a full-screen Notepad window, where I am typing the HTML tags right along with the content.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Can't muster a whole lot to say, though, at the moment, because I spent the wee hours composing a piece about, basically, coming out.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I'm a cis male. The closet I'm coming out of doesn't have a rainbow on the door, it has a capital ess and a lowercase zee. Sz.</p>
	<br><p>That's what I call Schizophrenia, and I pronounce it skizz. Butwait. Before you let that label take you places, let me say this.</p>
	<br><p>Sz does not mean psycho. Psychopathic is a whole different ballgame. Sz (usually) means suffering (episodes of) psychosis.</p>
	<br><p>What's psychosis? Well, an episode usually entails hallucinations, delusions, and mood changes. The more mood-affecting, the more likely it's Schizoaffective Disorder, not Sz. Or it could be Bipolar with Psychosis. It's, like, a spectrum.</p>
	<br><p>So but yeah, I got it. Had it for over a dozen years now. For me it was a big year-long episode at onset, and rare relapse-type events since.</p>
	<br><p>Delusions follow on the heels of hallucinations. When you hear somebody who isn't there saying something like "I am not you," it sets you off thinking who it might be, and that's where delusions kick in.</p>
	<br><p>But enough about Sz. Like I say, I wrote about it all last night, and I'm effete. Interested in checking out last night's output? It's on Medium.</p>
	<br><p>It's also on sop.mozello.com - or a coarse draft of it, anyway. Mozello was clamoring for me to house some actual content on their dime, rather than just a bunch of links, so I composed it there and in a swell eddy of the internet called Livejournal.</p>
	<br><p>The title is "Getting Busy", and here's the Medium link: https://dan-c-julian.medium.com/getting-busy-a-schizophrenic-blogoholic-ponders-spectra-insight-political-correctness-social-a8f77e16e9e1</p>
	<br><p>Cannot fault Mozello for their frustration at me using them as some kind of a switchboard to other sites. Some kind of Linktr.ee - have you seen these yet?</p>
	<br><p>Linktr.ee is... well, here's Comedy Central's if you wanna check it out: https://linktr.ee/comedycentral - it's just a list of links. Anyway, Mozello has been one of my Linktrees for some time, and they finally got fed up with it and called me out.</p>
	<br><p>Lists of links... hmm... What links could I share here, in the spirit of practicing simple HTML tags and formatting and just the mechanics of rapidly cutting and pasting and file-switching and browsing and whatall...</p>
	<br><p>I'll see what I can come up with.</p></h2>

	<blockquote><h2><p>Aw what the hey. Since you've troubled to view my humble efforts on this page/site... because a site ought to have more than one page, right?</p>
	<p>I'll drop the text of... not the clean version on Medium, but the coarse draft from Livejournal if I can find it... I'll drop it<a href="http://the-way.site44.com/here.html"> here.</a></p>
	<p>Ut oh. Looks like when I dropped it, it went splat. And now I cannot seem to get into it to clean it up. *sigh* Websites on free hosters from scratch in Notepad seemed like a good idea at the time.</p>
